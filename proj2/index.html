    <p>
      In this project we implemented both Bezier Curves/Surfaces and Triangle Meshes in order to
      model and render smooth curves, given 3D geometric models. It was interesting use both of
      these methods one after another to represent smooth surfaces.

          <p>
              Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
              De Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive way to evaluate Bezier curves of order <i>n</i>. From <i>n</i> points,
              at each recursive step, a linear interpolation is done between the points, reducing the number of points by 1.
              This is seen done for a arbitrary <i>t</i> value on the Bezier curve in the images above. Each step/level reduces
              points by 1 and adds a linear interpolation. The resulting point is given in red at level 5, which lies on the
              Bezier curve.
          </p>

          <p>
              The recursive step is implemented in <code>BezierCurve::evaluateStep</code>, which is a simple linear interpolation.
              This is done <i>n-1</i> times to obtain the Bezier curve point at time <i>t</i>. A slightly different Bezier curve
              is shown in the bottom right plot where two control points are flipped and <i>t</i> is changed.
          </p>

          <p>
              The de Casteljau algorithm described above allows us to take a set of 2D control points and draw a Bezier curve.
              Extending the set of control points to 3D, we can create a <i>n</i> by <i>n</i> grid of control points.
              For each row of control points in that grid, de Casteljau's algorithm will produce a Bezier curve with
              parameterization <i>t</i>. Then, all <i>n</i> Bezier curves at time <i>t</i> can be taken as a set of control
              points. De Casteljau's algorithm is applied again, this time with a different parameterization <i>u</i>.
              So, we can draw Bezier curves in <i>u</i> along the Bezier curves in <i>t</i>, creating a surface.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>

          <div align="middle">
              <table style="width=100%">
                  <tr>
                      <td>
                          <img src="images/teapot_default_task3.png" align="left" width="500px" />

                      <td>

                  </tr>

          </div>

          <p>
              Each triangle in a mesh has a normal vector, and flat shading can use that direction to assign a shade to each triangle.
              This is shown above with the flat shading teapot.  However, this is not good for smooth surfaces, as the mesh needs to
              become very fine to get a good looking image. 
          </p>
          <p>
              Phong shading uses interpolated normal vectors across each triangle to shade each pixel, getting a better shading for the same mesh. 
              This uses area-weighted normal vectors at each vertex of the mesh. This is implemented by iterating through triangles around a vertex
              through the use of halfedges. The two edges vectors of the triangle coming from the vertex can be cross producted to find a normal vector to 
              that triangle with length 2 * Area. An average of these normal vectors produces the area-weighted normal vector. 
          </p>
    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
    <p>
      We first designated variables for each of the relevant halfedges, vertices, and faces that
      we needed to modify or reference. Then, using the <code>Halfedge::setNeighbors</code> method,
      we modified pointers for the 6 halfedges inside the two triangles in question.
      The twins and associated edges were never changed, but the next pointers, associated vertices,
      and associated faces were sometimes modified.
      <br></br>
      As suggested by the spec, we did not create or delete any objects; rather, the middle edge's
      pointers were adjusted so that the edge would turn out flipped.
      <br></br>
      Lastly, the <code>halfedge</code> pointer on each vertex and face were updated, and the
      input edge <code>e0</code> was returned. The edges did not change which halfedge they were
      attached to, so they did not require modification.
      <br></br>
      As an edge case, at the beginning of the flip function, the function returns immediately
      if <code>e0->isBoundary()</code> is true, since boundary edges cannot be flipped.
    </p>

    <p>
    My debugging process was not very eventful. My code initially made a hole in the
    teapot when flipping an edge, but I was able to fix it by carefully rereading my code.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>
    <p>
      Similar to the edge flip operation, we start by returning immediately if
      <code>e0->isBoundary()</code> is true (no extra credit).
      Then, we assign each relevant existing mesh element to a variable.
      <br></br>
      Then, we create new mesh elements: 3 new edges, 6 halfedges, 1 vertex, and 2 faces.
      <br></br>
      Lastly, we adjust pointers of existing and new mesh elements. We move the middle/shared
      edge to be connected to the middle vertex and one of the existing vertices, then fill
      in the three remaining edge positions with the newly created elements.
      <br></br>
      We also set the position of the newly created vertex to the midpoint of vertices b and c,
      as notated in the spec. This is done with the following formula:
      <code>(c->position + b->position) / 2</code>. Lastly, we return the newly created vertex.
    </p>

        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>

    <p>
      My debugging journey was not very eventful. Similar to Part 4, I fixed my bugs by reading through
      my code carefully and fixing errors I caught. It was helpful drawing out a picture of the splitting
      process.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
    <p>
    Our implementation just follows the comments in the starter code. First, we calculate the new positions
    of both old and new vertices, storing them in the <code>newPosition</code> attribute of the associated
    vertex and edge objects. We also mark the old vertices' <code>isNew</code> attributes as <code>false</code>.
    <br></br>
    Then we perform 4-1 subdivision by splitting every old edge then flipping every
    edge that connects a new vertex to an old vertex. In the splitting step, one implementation hurdle was
    figuring out how to iterate over only the original edges. We did this by iterating only
    <code>mesh.nEdges()</code> number of times. We also set the vertex and edge <code>isNew</code> boolean
    attributes during the splitting phase for use in the flipping phase.
    <br></br>
    Lastly, for every vertex in the mesh, we update the actual vertex <code>position</code>'s
    using the <code>newPosition</code> values we recorded earlier.
    </p>

    <h4 align="left">Sharp edges</h4>
    <p>
    After loop subdivision, sharp corners and edges tend to be rounded out. We experimented in seeing if we
    can reduce this effect by performing lots of edge splits in one corner, and we saw that this does reduce
    the rounding-out effect by a bit.

    <h4 align="left">Cube asymmetry</h4>
    <p>
    Several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube results in some asymmetry. We tried to alleviate this
    by splitting each diagonal edge on each face of the cube once. The general idea here was that, if the
    starting cube is more symmetrical, then the cube after loop subdivision hopefully should be more symmetrical
    as well.
    <br></br>
    Below are pictures of the cube with and without the preprocessing edge splitting, before
    and after 5 iterations of loop subdivision each.
